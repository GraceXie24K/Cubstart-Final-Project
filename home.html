            Design-a-Thon is split into three events: Sweet Shop, 
            Sounds of Creativity and Combination Domination, more about which can be found on the 
            <a id = lemon24k href = 'event.html'> Events </a> 
            page. During events, each participant of Design-a-Thon will be assigned a prompt
             to which they can design a character according to. Submissions from participants will 
             be displayed on the event homepage.
